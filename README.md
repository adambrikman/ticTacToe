<!-- DESCRIPTION/ -->
The final project for CS50 was to simply 'make something.' During the course I used C, Python, JavaScript and the JQuery library. Since JQuery was one of the most recent technologies used in the course, I took it upon myself to use it for my final project.

I decided to just build a simple game of Tic-Tac-Toe because I knew all of the rules to the game - all I had to do was write them with JQuery, HTML and CSS. Since this was my first course in Computer Science, this project was tough. It looks a little rough but it works!

In hindsight, it's a simple project. It's refreshing to look back and see how much I've grown since first building this Tic-Tac-Toe game!
